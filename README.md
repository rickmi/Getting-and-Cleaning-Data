## "Getting and Cleaning Data" Assignment

Perform these steps before running the R script.

* Create a New Folder to be used as a temporary working directory
* Download the `run_analysis.R` script and place in this folder.
* Download the required data file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
* Extract the zip file to the Folder you recently created. (you should now see a subfolder called `UCI HAR Dataset`
* Launch R or RStudio and use the command setwd() and update your working directory to the Folder where the `run_analysis.R` script is located.
* Run the script.
 
The output of the R script will be a tidy data set called `tidydata.txt` located in your working directory.


** Note this R Script requires the [plyr package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html)
